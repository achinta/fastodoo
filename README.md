## fastodoo
Odoo is a popular open source ERP. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. FastOdoo aims to expose the odoo data as Rest API
for reading, while using Odoo ORM for updates. It reads the Odoo model and field metadata dynamically from ir_model_fields to minimize coding. 

## Contribute
Currently it is very raw, with mainly the dynamic models implemented. Contributions, suggestions are welcome! Please look at issues for pending tasks.
